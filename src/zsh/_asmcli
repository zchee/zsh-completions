#                                       will be applied to the istio-system namespace. For GKE,
#                                       defaults to the network name for the cluster. For other
#                                       environments, "default" will be used.
#   -c|--ca                <CA>         The type of certificate authority to be
#                                       used. Defaults to "mesh_ca" for install.
#                                       Allowed values for <CA> are {citadel|mesh_ca|gcp_cas|managed_cas}.
#                                       managed_cas is experimental.

#                                       apply. For options, see the
#                                       anthos-service-mesh-package GitHub
#                                       repo under GoogleCloudPlatform. Files
#                                       should be in "asm/istio/options" folder,
#                                       and shouldn't include the .yaml extension.
#                                       (See https://git.io/JTDdi for options.)
#                                       To add multiple files, specify them with
#                                       multiple options one at a time.
#   -s|--service_account   <ACCOUNT>    The name of a service account used to
#                                       install ASM. If not specified, the gcloud
#                                       user currently configured will be used.
#   -k|--key_file          <FILE PATH>  The key file for a service account. This
#                                       option can be omitted if not using a
#                                       service account.
#   -D|--output_dir        <DIR PATH>   The directory where this script will place
#                                       downloaded ASM packages and configuration.
#                                       If not specified, a temporary directory
#                                       will be created. If specified and the
#                                       directory already contains the necessary
#                                       files, they will be used instead of
#                                       downloading them again.
#   --co|--custom_overlay  <FILE PATH>  The location of a YAML file to overlay on
#                                       the ASM IstioOperator. This option can be
#                                       omitted if not installing optional
#                                       features. To add multiple files, specify
#                                       them with multiple options one at a time.
#   --ca_pool              <CA POOL>    Required only if --ca option is gcp_cas.
#                                       Name of the ca pool in the GCP CAS service used to
#                                       sign certificates in the format
#                                       'projects/project_name/locations/ca_region/caPools/ca_pool'. If certificate template
#                                       needs to be specified, the format is 'projects/project_name/locations/ca_region/caPools/ca_pool:projects/project_name/locations/ca_region/certificateTemplates/cert_template'.
#   -r|--revision_name <REVISION NAME>  Custom revision label. Label needs to follow DNS
#                                       label formats (re: RFC 1123). Not supported if
#                                       control plane is managed. Prefixing the revision
#                                       name with 'asm' is recommended.
#   --platform             <PLATFORM>   The platorm or the provider of the kubernetes
#                                       cluster. Defaults to "gcp" (for GKE clusters).
#                                       For all other platforms use "multicloud".
#                                       Allowed values for <PLATFORM> are {gcp|multicloud}.
#
#   The following four options must be passed together and are only necessary
#   for using a custom certificate for Citadel. Users that aren't sure whether
#   they need this probably don't.
#
#   --ca_cert              <FILE PATH>  The intermediate certificate
#   --ca_key               <FILE PATH>  The key for the intermediate certificate
#   --root_cert            <FILE PATH>  The root certificate
#   --cert_chain           <FILE PATH>  The certificate chain
#
# FLAGS:
#
#   The following several flags all relate to allowing the script to create, set,
#   or enable required APIs, roles, or services. These can all be performed
#   manually before running the script if desired. To allow the script to perform
#   every necessary action, pass the -e|--enable_all flag. All of these flags
#   are incompatible with --only_validate.
#
#      --disable_ui                     Indicates that you do not wish to use the ASM UI, disabling
#                                       some feature checks.
#   -e|--enable_all                     Allow the script to perform all of the
#                                       individual enable actions below. (Fleet
#                                       registration won't happen unless necessary
#                                       for a selected option.)
#      --enable_cluster_roles           Allow the script to attempt to set
#                                       the necessary cluster roles.
#      --enable_cluster_labels          Allow the script to attempt to set
#                                       necessary cluster labels.
#      --enable_gcp_apis                Allow the script to enable GCP APIs on
#                                       the user's behalf
#      --enable_gcp_iam_roles           Allow the script to set the required GCP
#                                       IAM permissions
#      --enable_gcp_components          Allow the script to enable required GCP
#                                       managed services and components
#      --enable_meshconfig_init         Allow the script to initialize the meshconfig
#                                       endpoint on your behalf. Implied by
#                                       --enable_gcp_components and --managed.
#      --enable_registration            Allow the script to register the cluster
#                                       to a fleet
#      --enable_namespace_creation      Allow the script to create the istio-system
#                                       namespace for the user
#      --use_managed_cni                Deprecated. Managed CNI now defaults to be on.
#      --managed                        Deprecated. Provision a remote, managed control plane
#                                       instead of installing one in-cluster.
#                                       The channel matches with the GKE version:
#                                         GKE Channel  |  ASM Channel
#                                         -------------|----------------

#      --use_vpcsc                      Provision a remote, managed control plane in
#                                       VPCSC environment.
#      --offline                        Perform an offline installation using the pre-downloaded
#                                       package in the output directory. If the directory is not
#                                       specified or does not contain the required files, the
#                                       script will exit with error.
#      --disable_canonical_service      DEPRECATED: This flag is now a no-operation.
#                                       The managed Canonical Service Controller is always provisioned.
#                                       It is required for the ASM UI to support various features.
#                                       Adding this flag will have no effect.
#      --managed_certificates           Enable the managed certificates, which automatically manages
#                                       the workload certificates. When this flag is enabled,
#                                       you should not specify the --ca option.
#   -v|--verbose                        Print commands before and after execution.
#      --dry_run                        Print commands, but don't execute them.
