#                               remaining URLs are used for backup. If less than

#
#  --file-allocation=METHOD     Specify file allocation method.
#                               'none' doesn't pre-allocate file space. 'prealloc'
#                               pre-allocates file space before download begins.
#                               This may take some time depending on the size of
#                               the file.
#                               If you are using newer file systems such as ext4
#                               (with extents support), btrfs, xfs or NTFS
#                               (MinGW build only), 'falloc' is your best
#                               choice. It allocates large(few GiB) files
#                               almost instantly. Don't use 'falloc' with legacy
#                               file systems such as ext3 and FAT32 because it
#                               takes almost same time as 'prealloc' and it
#                               blocks aria2 entirely until allocation finishes.
#                               'falloc' may not be available if your system
#                               doesn't have posix_fallocate() function.
#                               'trunc' uses ftruncate() system call or
#                               platform-specific counterpart to truncate a file
#                               to a specified length.
#
#                               Possible Values: none, prealloc, trunc, falloc

#  -V, --check-integrity[=true|false] Check file integrity by validating piece
#                               hashes or a hash of entire file. This option has
#                               effect only in BitTorrent, Metalink downloads
#                               with checksums or HTTP(S)/FTP downloads with
#                               --checksum option. If piece hashes are provided,
#                               this option can detect damaged portions of a file
#                               and re-download them. If a hash of entire file is
#                               provided, hash check is only done when file has
#                               been already download. This is determined by file
#                               length. If hash check fails, file is
#                               re-downloaded from scratch. If both piece hashes
#                               and a hash of entire file are provided, only
#                               piece hashes are used.

#                               which downloads files sequentially from the
#                               beginning. Currently this option is only
#                               applicable to http(s)/ftp downloads.
#
#                               Possible Values: true, false

#                               URIs on a single line using the TAB character.
#                               Reads input from stdin when '-' is specified.
#                               Additionally, options can be specified after each
#                               line of URI. This optional line must start with
#                               one or more white spaces and have one option per

#  -k, --min-split-size=SIZE    aria2 does not split less than 2*SIZE byte range.
#                               For example, let's consider downloading 20MiB
#                               file. If SIZE is 10M, aria2 can split file into 2
#                               range [0-10MiB) and [10MiB-20MiB) and download it
#                               using 2 sources(if --split >= 2, of course).
#                               If SIZE is 15M, since 2*15M > 20MiB, aria2 does
#                               not split file and download it using 1 source.

#
# URI, MAGNET, TORRENT_FILE, METALINK_FILE:
#  You can specify multiple HTTP(S)/FTP URIs. Unless you specify -Z option, all
#  URIs must point to the same file or downloading will fail.
#  You can also specify arbitrary number of BitTorrent Magnet URIs, torrent/
#  metalink files stored in a local drive. Please note that they are always
#  treated as a separate download.
#
#  You can specify both torrent file with -T option and URIs. By doing this,
#  download a file from both torrent swarm and HTTP/FTP server at the same time,
#  while the data from HTTP/FTP are uploaded to the torrent swarm. For single file
#  torrents, URI can be a complete URI pointing to the resource or if URI ends
#  with '/', 'name' in torrent file is added. For multi-file torrents, 'name' and
#  'path' in torrent are added to form a URI for each file.
#
#  Make sure that URI is quoted with single(') or double(") quotation if it
#  contains "&" or any characters that have special meaning in shell.
#
# About the number of connections
#  Since 1.10.0 release, aria2 uses 1 connection per host by default and has 20MiB
#  segment size restriction. So whatever value you specify using -s option, it
#  uses 1 connection per host. To make it behave like 1.9.x, use
#  --max-connection-per-server=4 --min-split-size=1M.

#  --piece-length=LENGTH        Set a piece length for HTTP/FTP downloads. This
#                               is the boundary when aria2 splits a file. All
#                               splits occur at multiple of this length. This
#                               option will be ignored in BitTorrent downloads.
#                               It will be also ignored if Metalink file
#                               contains piece hashes.

#                               later. This may reduce memory usage if input
#                               file contains a lot of URIs to download.
#                               If false is given, aria2 reads all URIs and

#                               available. aria2 uses the download speed observed
#                               in the previous downloads to adapt the number of
#                               downloads launched in parallel according to the
#                               rule N = A + B Log10(speed in Mbps). The
#                               coefficients A and B can be customized in the
#                               option arguments with A and B separated by a
#                               colon. The default values (A=5,B=25) lead to
#                               using typically 5 parallel downloads on 1Mbps
#                               networks and above 50 on 100Mbps networks. The
#                               number of parallel downloads remains constrained
#                               under the maximum defined by the

#                               bytes. The cache storage is created for aria2

#                               These metadata downloads will generate downloads
#                               using their metadata. This option pauses these

#                                    current soft limit.
#                               This is equivalent to setting nofile via ulimit,

#                               contains 5 files, then file size is the total
#                               size of those files. If file size is strictly

#  --on-bt-download-complete=COMMAND For BitTorrent, a command specified in

#  -k, --min-split-size=SIZE    aria2 does not split less than 2*SIZE byte range.
#                               For example, let's consider downloading 20MiB
#                               file. If SIZE is 10M, aria2 can split file into 2
#                               range [0-10MiB) and [10MiB-20MiB) and download it
#                               using 2 sources(if --split >= 2, of course).
#                               If SIZE is 15M, since 2*15M > 20MiB, aria2 does
#                               not split file and download it using 1 source.
#                               You can append K or M(1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K).

#
#  --stream-piece-selector=SELECTOR Specify piece selection algorithm
#                               used in HTTP/FTP download. Piece means fixed
#                               length segment which is downloaded in parallel
#                               in segmented download. If 'default' is given,
#                               aria2 selects piece so that it reduces the
#                               number of establishing connection. This is
#                               reasonable default behaviour because
#                               establishing connection is an expensive
#                               operation.
#                               If 'inorder' is given, aria2 selects piece which
#                               has minimum index. Index=0 means first of the
#                               file. This will be useful to view movie while
#                               downloading it. --enable-http-pipelining option
#                               may be useful to reduce reconnection overhead.
#                               Please note that aria2 honors
#                               --min-split-size option, so it will be necessary
#                               to specify a reasonable value to
#                               --min-split-size option.
#                               If 'random' is given, aria2 selects piece
#                               randomly. Like 'inorder', --min-split-size
#                               option is honored.
#                               If 'geom' is given, at the beginning aria2
#                               selects piece which has minimum index like
#                               'inorder', but it exponentially increasingly
#                               keeps space from previously selected piece. This
#                               will reduce the number of establishing connection
#                               and at the same time it will download the
#                               beginning part of the file first. This will be
#                               useful to view movie while downloading it.

#                               For example, setting sha-1 digest looks like
#                               this:

#                               For supplementary ones, it returns mirrors which
#                               has not been tested yet, and if each of them has
#                               already been tested, returns mirrors which has to
#                               be tested again. Otherwise, it doesn't select
#                               anymore mirrors. Like 'feedback', it uses a

#  -k, --min-split-size=SIZE    aria2 does not split less than 2*SIZE byte range.
#                               For example, let's consider downloading 20MiB
#                               file. If SIZE is 10M, aria2 can split file into 2
#                               range [0-10MiB) and [10MiB-20MiB) and download it
#                               using 2 sources(if --split >= 2, of course).
#                               If SIZE is 15M, since 2*15M > 20MiB, aria2 does
#                               not split file and download it using 1 source.
#                               You can append K or M(1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K).

#
#  --stream-piece-selector=SELECTOR Specify piece selection algorithm
#                               used in HTTP/FTP download. Piece means fixed
#                               length segment which is downloaded in parallel
#                               in segmented download. If 'default' is given,
#                               aria2 selects piece so that it reduces the
#                               number of establishing connection. This is
#                               reasonable default behaviour because
#                               establishing connection is an expensive
#                               operation.
#                               If 'inorder' is given, aria2 selects piece which
#                               has minimum index. Index=0 means first of the
#                               file. This will be useful to view movie while
#                               downloading it. --enable-http-pipelining option
#                               may be useful to reduce reconnection overhead.
#                               Please note that aria2 honors
#                               --min-split-size option, so it will be necessary
#                               to specify a reasonable value to
#                               --min-split-size option.
#                               If 'random' is given, aria2 selects piece
#                               randomly. Like 'inorder', --min-split-size
#                               option is honored.
#                               If 'geom' is given, at the beginning aria2
#                               selects piece which has minimum index like
#                               'inorder', but it exponentially increasingly
#                               keeps space from previously selected piece. This
#                               will reduce the number of establishing connection
#                               and at the same time it will download the
#                               beginning part of the file first. This will be
#                               useful to view movie while downloading it.

#  --file-allocation=METHOD     Specify file allocation method.

#                               pre-allocates file space before download begins.
#                               This may take some time depending on the size of

#                               almost instantly. Don't use 'falloc' with legacy
#                               file systems such as ext3 and FAT32 because it
#                               takes almost same time as 'prealloc' and it
#                               blocks aria2 entirely until allocation finishes.
#                               'falloc' may not be available if your system
#                               doesn't have posix_fallocate() function.
#                               'trunc' uses ftruncate() system call or
#                               platform-specific counterpart to truncate a file
