# gosec - Golang security checker
#
# gosec analyzes Go source code to look for common programming mistakes that
# can lead to security problems.
#
# VERSION: 
# GIT TAG: 
# BUILD DATE: 
#
# USAGE:
#
# 	# Check a single package
# 	$ gosec $GOPATH/src/github.com/example/project
#
# 	# Check all packages under the current directory and save results in
# 	# json format.
# 	$ gosec -fmt=json -out=results.json ./...
#
# 	# Run a specific set of rules (by default all rules will be run):
# 	$ gosec -include=G101,G203,G401  ./...
#
# 	# Run all rules except the provided
# 	$ gosec -exclude=G101 $GOPATH/src/github.com/example/project/...
#
#
# OPTIONS:
#
#   -conf string
#     	Path to optional config file
#   -exclude string
#     	Comma separated list of rules IDs to exclude. (see rule list)
#   -fmt string
#     	Set output format. Valid options are: json, yaml, csv, junit-xml, html, or text (default "text")
#   -include string
#     	Comma separated list of rules IDs to include. (see rule list)
#   -log string
#     	Log messages to file rather than stderr
#   -nosec
#     	Ignores #nosec comments when set
#   -out string
#     	Set output file for results
#   -quiet
#     	Only show output when errors are found
#   -severity string
#     	Fail the scanning for issues with the given or higher severity. Valid options are: low, medium, high (default "low")
#   -sort
#     	Sort issues by severity (default true)
#   -tags string
#     	Comma separated list of build tags
#   -vendor
#     	Scan the vendor folder
#
#
# RULES:
#
# 	G101: Look for hardcoded credentials
# 	G102: Bind to all interfaces
# 	G103: Audit the use of unsafe block
# 	G104: Audit errors not checked
# 	G105: Audit the use of big.Exp function
# 	G106: Audit the use of ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey function
# 	G107: Url provided to HTTP request as taint input
# 	G201: SQL query construction using format string
# 	G202: SQL query construction using string concatenation
# 	G203: Use of unescaped data in HTML templates
# 	G204: Audit use of command execution
# 	G301: Poor file permissions used when creating a directory
# 	G302: Poor file permisions used when creation file or using chmod
# 	G303: Creating tempfile using a predictable path
# 	G304: File path provided as taint input
# 	G305: File path traversal when extracting zip archive
# 	G401: Detect the usage of DES, RC4, MD5 or SHA1
# 	G402: Look for bad TLS connection settings
# 	G403: Ensure minimum RSA key length of 2048 bits
# 	G404: Insecure random number source (rand)
# 	G501: Import blacklist: crypto/md5
# 	G502: Import blacklist: crypto/des
# 	G503: Import blacklist: crypto/rc4
# 	G504: Import blacklist: net/http/cgi
