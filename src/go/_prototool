#
# Create the given Protobuf files according to a template that passes default
# prototool lint.
#
# Assuming the filename "example_create_file.proto", the file will look like the
# following:
#
#   syntax = "proto3";
#
#   package SOME.PKG;
#
#   option go_package = "PKGpb";
#   option java_multiple_files = true;
#   option java_outer_classname = "ExampleCreateFileProto";
#   option java_package = "com.SOME.PKG.pb";
#
# This matches what the linter expects. "SOME.PKG" will be computed as follows:
#
# - If "--package" is specified, "SOME.PKG" will be the value passed to
#   "--package".
# - Otherwise, if there is no "prototool.yaml" or "prototool.json" that would
#   apply to the new file, use "uber.prototool.generated".
# - Otherwise, if there is a "prototool.yaml" or "prototool.json" file, check if
#   it has a "packages" setting under the "create" section. If it does, this
#   package, concatenated with the relative path from the directory with the
#  "prototool.yaml" or "prototool.json" will be used.
# - Otherwise, if there is no "packages" directive, just use the
#   relative path from the directory with the "prototool.yaml" or
#   "prototool.json" file. If the file is in the same directory as the
#   "prototool.yaml" or "prototool.json" file, use "uber.prototool.generated".
#
# For example, assume you have the following file at "repo/prototool.yaml":
#
# create:
#   packages:
# 	- directory: idl
# 	  name: uber
# 	- directory: idl/baz
# 	  name: special
#
# - "prototool create repo/idl/foo/bar/bar.proto" will have the package
#   "uber.foo.bar".
# - "prototool create repo/idl/bar.proto" will have the package "uber".
# - "prototool create repo/idl/baz/baz.proto" will have the package "special".
# - "prototool create repo/idl/baz/bat/bat.proto" will have the package
#   "special.bat".
# - "prototool create repo/another/dir/bar.proto" will have the package
#   "another.dir".
# - "prototool create repo/bar.proto" will have the package
#   "uber.prototool.generated".
#
# This is meant to mimic what you generally want - a base package for your idl
# directory, followed by packages matching the directory structure.
#
# Note you can override the directory that the "prototool.yaml" or
# "prototool.json" file is in as well. If we update our file at
# "repo/prototool.yaml" to this:
#
# create:
#   packages:
# 	- directory: .
# 	  name: foo.bar
#
# Then "prototool create repo/bar.proto" will have the package "foo.bar", and
# "prototool create repo/another/dir/bar.proto" will have the package
# "foo.bar.another.dir".
#
# If Vim integration is set up, files will be generated when you open a new
# Protobuf file.

# Call a gRPC endpoint. Be sure to set the required flags address, method, and

# This command compiles your proto files with "protoc", converts JSON input to

#
# There is a full example for gRPC in the example directory of Prototool. Run

# Lint proto files and compile with protoc to check for failures.
#
# Lint rules can be set using the configuration file. See the configuration at
# https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/etc/config/example/prototool.yaml for
# all available options. There are two pre-configured groups of rules:
#
# google: This lint group follows the Style Guide at
# https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style. This is a small group
# of rules meant to enforce basic naming, and is widely followed.
#
# uber1: This lint group follows the Style Guide at
# https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/master/etc/style/uber1/uber1.proto. This
# is a very strict rule group and is meant to enforce consistent development
# patterns.
#
# Configuration of your group can be done by setting the "lint.group" option in
# your "prototool.yaml" file:
#
# lint:
#   group: google
#
# The "uber1" lint group represents the default lint group, and will be used if no
# lint group is configured.
#
# Files must be valid Protobuf that can be compiled with protoc, so prior to
# linting, prototool lint will compile your using protoc.
# Note, however, this is very fast - for two files, compiling and linting only
# takes approximately
# 3/100ths of a second:
#
# $ time prototool lint etc/style/uber1
#
# real	0m0.037s
# user	0m0.026s
# sys	0m0.017s
#
# For all 694 Protobuf files currently in
# https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis, this takes approximately 3/4ths of a
# second:
#
# $ cat prototool.yaml
# protoc:
#   allow_unused_imports: true
# lint:
#   group: google
#
# $ time prototool lint .
