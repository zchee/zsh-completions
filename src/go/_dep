#
# Dep is a tool for managing dependencies for Go projects
#
# Usage: "dep [command]"
#
# Commands:
#
#   init     Initialize a new project with manifest and lock files
#   status   Report the status of the project's dependencies
#   ensure   Ensure a dependency is safely vendored in the project
#   prune    Prune the vendor tree of unused packages
#   version  Show the dep version information
#
# Examples:
#   dep init                               set up a new project
#   dep ensure                             install the project's dependencies
#   dep ensure -update                     update the locked versions of all dependencies
#   dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/errors  add a dependency to the project
#
# Use "dep help [command]" for more information about a command.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Usage: dep init [root]
#
# Initialize the project at filepath root by parsing its dependencies, writing
# manifest and lock files, and vendoring the dependencies. If root isn't
# specified, use the current directory.
#
# When configuration for another dependency management tool is detected, it is
# imported into the initial manifest and lock. Use the -skip-tools flag to
# disable this behavior. The following external tools are supported:
# glide, godep, vndr, govend, gb, gvt, govendor, glock.
#
# Any dependencies that are not constrained by external configuration use the
# GOPATH analysis below.
#
# By default, the dependencies are resolved over the network. A version will be
# selected from the versions available from the upstream source per the following
# algorithm:
#
#  - Tags conforming to semver (sorted by semver rules)
#  - Default branch(es) (sorted lexicographically)
#  - Non-semver tags (sorted lexicographically)
#
# An alternate mode can be activated by passing -gopath. In this mode, the version
# of each dependency will reflect the current state of the GOPATH. If a dependency
# doesn't exist in the GOPATH, a version will be selected based on the above
# network version selection algorithm.
#
# A Gopkg.toml file will be written with inferred version constraints for all
# direct dependencies. Gopkg.lock will be written with precise versions, and
# vendor/ will be populated with the precise versions written to Gopkg.lock.
#
# Flags:
#
#   -gopath       search in GOPATH for dependencies (default: false)
#   -no-examples  don't include example in Gopkg.toml (default: false)
#   -skip-tools   skip importing configuration from other dependency managers (default: false)
#   -v            enable verbose logging (default: false)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Usage: dep status [package...]
#
# With no arguments, print the status of each dependency of the project.
#
#   PROJECT     Import path
#   CONSTRAINT  Version constraint, from the manifest
#   VERSION     Version chosen, from the lock
#   REVISION    VCS revision of the chosen version
#   LATEST      Latest VCS revision available
#   PKGS USED   Number of packages from this project that are actually used
#
# You may use the -f flag to create a custom format for the output of the
# dep status command. The available fields you can utilize are as follows:
# ProjectRoot, Constraint, Version, Revision, Latest, and PackageCount.
#
# Status returns exit code zero if all dependencies are in a "good state".
#
# Flags:
#
#   -dot       output the dependency graph in GraphViz format (default: false)
#   -examples  print detailed usage examples (default: false)
#   -f         output in text/template format (default: <none>)
#   -json      output in JSON format (default: false)
#   -missing   only show missing dependencies (default: false)
#   -old       only show out-of-date dependencies (default: false)
#   -v         enable verbose logging (default: false)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Usage: dep ensure [-update | -add] [-no-vendor | -vendor-only] [-dry-run] [-v] [<spec>...]
#
# Project spec:
#
#   <import path>[:alt source URL][@<constraint>]
#
#
# Ensure gets a project into a complete, reproducible, and likely compilable state:
#
#   * All non-stdlib imports are fulfilled
#   * All rules in Gopkg.toml are respected
#   * Gopkg.lock records precise versions for all dependencies
#   * vendor/ is populated according to Gopkg.lock
#
# Ensure has fast techniques to determine that some of these steps may be
# unnecessary. If that determination is made, ensure may skip some steps. Flags
# may be passed to bypass these checks; -vendor-only will allow an out-of-date
# Gopkg.lock to populate vendor/, and -no-vendor will update Gopkg.lock (if
# needed), but never touch vendor/.
#
# The effect of passing project spec arguments varies slightly depending on the
# combination of flags that are passed.
#
#
# Examples:
#
#   dep ensure                                 Populate vendor from existing Gopkg.toml and Gopkg.lock
#   dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/foo         Introduce a named dependency at its newest version
#   dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/foo@^1.0.1  Introduce a named dependency with a particular constraint
#
# For more detailed usage examples, see dep ensure -examples.
#
# Flags:
#
#   -add          add new dependencies, or populate Gopkg.toml with constraints for existing dependencies (default: false)
#   -dry-run      only report the changes that would be made (default: false)
#   -examples     print detailed usage examples (default: false)
#   -no-vendor    update Gopkg.lock (if needed), but do not update vendor/ (default: false)
#   -update       update the named dependencies (or all, if none are named) in Gopkg.lock to the latest allowed by Gopkg.toml (default: false)
#   -v            enable verbose logging (default: false)
#   -vendor-only  populate vendor/ from Gopkg.lock without updating it first (default: false)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Usage: dep prune 
#
# Prune was merged into the ensure command.
# Set prune options in the manifest and it will be applied after every ensure.
# dep prune will be removed in a future version of dep, causing this command to exit non-0.
#
# Flags:
#
#   -v  enable verbose logging (default: false)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Usage: dep version 
#
# Show the dep version information
#
# Flags:
#
#   -v  enable verbose logging (default: false)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# flag provided but not defined: -v
# Usage: dep check [-q] [-skip-lock] [-skip-vendor]
#
# Check determines if your project is in a good state. If problems are found, it
# prints a description of each issue, then exits 1. Passing -q suppresses output.
#
# Flags control which specific checks will be run. By default, dep check verifies
# that Gopkg.lock is in sync with Gopkg.toml and the imports in your project's .go
# files, and that the vendor directory is in sync with Gopkg.lock. These checks
# can be disabled with -skip-lock and -skip-vendor, respectively.
#
# (See https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/ensure-mechanics.html#staying-in-sync for
# more information on what it means to be "in sync.")
#
# If your workflow necessitates that you modify the contents of vendor, you can
# force check to ignore hash mismatches on a per-project basis by naming
# project roots in Gopkg.toml's "noverify" list.
#
# Flags:
#
#   -q            Suppress non-error output (default: false)
#   -skip-lock    Skip checking that imports and Gopkg.toml are in sync with Gopkg.lock (default: false)
#   -skip-vendor  Skip checking that vendor is in sync with Gopkg.lock (default: false)
