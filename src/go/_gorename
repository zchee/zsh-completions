#
# gorename: precise type-safe renaming of identifiers in Go source code.
#
# Usage:
#  gorename (-from <spec> | -offset <file>:#<byte-offset>) -to <name> [-force]
#
# You must specify the object (named entity) to rename using the -offset
# or -from flag.  Exactly one must be specified.
#
# Flags:
#
# -offset    specifies the filename and byte offset of an identifier to rename.
#            This form is intended for use by text editors.
#
# -from      specifies the object to rename using a query notation;
#            This form is intended for interactive use at the command line.
#            A legal -from query has one of the following forms:
#
#   "encoding/json".Decoder.Decode     method of package-level named type
#   (*"encoding/json".Decoder).Decode  ditto, alternative syntax
#   "encoding/json".Decoder.buf        field of package-level named struct type
#   "encoding/json".HTMLEscape         package member (const, func, var, type)
#   "encoding/json".Decoder.Decode::x  local object x within a method
#   "encoding/json".HTMLEscape::x      local object x within a function
#   "encoding/json"::x                 object x anywhere within a package
#   json.go::x                         object x within file json.go
#
#            Double-quotes must be escaped when writing a shell command.
#            Quotes may be omitted for single-segment import paths
#            such as "fmt".
#
#            For methods, the parens and '*' on the receiver type are both
#            optional.
#
#            It is an error if one of the ::x queries matches multiple
#            objects.
#
# -to        the new name.
#
# -force     causes the renaming to proceed even if conflicts were reported.
#            The resulting program may be ill-formed, or experience a change
#            in behaviour.
#
#            WARNING: this flag may even cause the renaming tool to crash.
#            (In due course this bug will be fixed by moving certain
#            analyses into the type-checker.)
#
# -d         display diffs instead of rewriting files
#
# -diffcmd
#            diff command invoked when using -d (default "diff")
#
# -tags
#            a list of build tags to consider satisfied during the build.
#            For more information about build tags, see the description of
#            build constraints in the documentation for the go/build package
#
# -v         enables verbose logging.
#
# -help
#            show usage message
#
# gorename automatically computes the set of packages that might be
# affected.  For a local renaming, this is just the package specified by
# -from or -offset, but for a potentially exported name, gorename scans
# the workspace ($GOROOT and $GOPATH).
#
# gorename rejects renamings of concrete methods that would change the
# assignability relation between types and interfaces.  If the interface
# change was intentional, initiate the renaming at the interface method.
#
# gorename rejects any renaming that would create a conflict at the point
# of declaration, or a reference conflict (ambiguity or shadowing), or
# anything else that could cause the resulting program not to compile.
#
#
# Examples:
#
# $ gorename -offset file.go:#123 -to foo
#
#   Rename the object whose identifier is at byte offset 123 within file.go.
#
# $ gorename -from '"bytes".Buffer.Len' -to Size
#
#   Rename the "Len" method of the *bytes.Buffer type to "Size".
